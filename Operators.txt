Division	/	returns the quotient of two operands	15 / 3	5
Multiplication	*	returns the product of two operands	3 * 2	6
Modulo



Logical Operators
Name	Symbol	Description	Example	Result
Logical NOT	!	returns the opposite boolean value of an operand	!true	false
Logical AND	&&	returns true only if both operands are true	true && true	true
Logical OR	||	returns true if one of two operands is true	false || true	true
 


Relational Operators
Name	Symbol	Description	Example	Result
Greater Than	>	returns true if the first operand is greater than the second operand	5 > 10	false
Less Than	<	returns true if the first operand is less than the second operand	5 < 10	true
Greater Than or Equal To	>=	returns true if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand	2 >= 2	true
Less Than or Equal To	<=	returns true if the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand	2 <= 2	true
Equal To	==	returns true if both operands have the same value	1 == 2	false
Not Equal To	!=	returns true if both operands have different values	1 != 2	true
