- Switch statements do not strictly use a boolean condition to drive logic; instead, a switch statement is provided with a 
  variable expression and  then compares the value of that expression against specified case values.
- The switch variable datatype should match the datatype of the case statement value'

- A switch statement should have a default case at the end, and this will be called if no previous case statements match the switch value.
- A break Keyword will stop the execution of the logic whenever a condition is met.
- We use a breack keyword in switch statement because  switch statements exhibit, means that if there is no break, the code wont stop running even
  the condition is met
