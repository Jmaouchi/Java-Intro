# What is an Abstract class?
* An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated directly using the class' constructor, and is used with inheritance to create superclasses in which other, specific implementation can exist.
* Abstract classes also provide the benefit of being able to declare abstract methods within the class, which enforces a subclass to provide an overridden version of that method.


# Need to know
  When we create an Abstract class that has an abstract method, we always need to add implementations into the method where we override it
