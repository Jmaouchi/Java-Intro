# Queue
A queue is a data structure that is ordered and whose elements are worked with from only the beginning and end of the data structure. An element is ordered when it holds a specific position in the data structure. Queues adhere to the “first-in, first-out,” or FIFO method of processing elements. When adding to a queue, the element is added to the end of the data structure. When removing an element from the queue, the element at the beginning of the data structure is removed

# Common queue operations:

* offer: add to the end of the data structure
* dequeue: remove from the front of the data structure
* peek: get the first element in the data structure
* removing from the queue: queue.poll();
