# Description:
A Hashset is a commonly used implementation of the Set interface of the Collection API. Sets are data structures which do not contain duplicate values. Additionally, data within a HashSet is not guaranteed to be placed or retrieved in any particular order. Sets are commonly used as part of other systems, or when the idenfication of a unique value is important.

# Common HashSet methods:

* add : Adds the specified element into the set, if it is not already present. Returns true if the elements is added. Returns false otherwise.
* remove : Removes the specified element from the set, if it is preset. Returns true if the element is removed. Returns false otherwise.
* contains : Returns true if the specified element exists within the collection.
