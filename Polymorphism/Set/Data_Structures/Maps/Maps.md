# About HashMap 
A HashMap is a commonly used implementation of the Map interface which is part of the Collections Framework, but does not inherit from the Collection interface. A map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs where each key is unique. A key-value pair is made up of two elements that are associated with one another. The key is what the map uses to uniquely identify and locate its related value. Together, these key-value pairs make up an entry in a Map. Additionally, data within a HashMap is not guaranteed to be placed or retrieved in any particular order. Sets are commonly used as part of other systems, or when the idenfication of a unique value is important.


# Common HashMap methods:

* put: Adds a key-value pair to the Map. If the key is already in the Map, it will be associated with the new value.
* remove: Removes a key-value pair from the Map
* get: Returns the value associated with a key
* values: Returns a collection of values that are contained within the Map
* keySet: Returns a set of all the keys in the Map
* entrySet: Returns all of the entries in the Map
