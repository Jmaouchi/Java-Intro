# Stacks
A stack is a data structure that adheres to the “last-in, first-out,” or LIFO, method of processing elements. The last element of a stack is the “top." When adding or removing from a stack, you start at the top. Like a Stack of books, the last book you add to the stack is the top of your stack of books. 
There are two Java classes that can be used to implement the Stack data structure: the Stack class and the ArrayDeque class. It is recommended to use the ArrayDeque class over the Stack class to implement a Stack

# Common stack operations:
* push: add to the end of the data structure
* pop: remove from the end of the data structure
* peek: get the last element in the data structure
