# Description:
You've previously learned to cast primitive values. Recall that an object's class is also considered its type. We can also do object type casting, which is where we change the type of the reference variable that is pointing to an object. We are able to do this by taking advantage of Inheritance: if you have a subtype object, you can reference it using a reference variable that is of its own type, or that of a parent type. There are two ways to cast with object types:

* Upcasting: Having a supertype reference variable point to a subtype object.

* Downcasting: Changing a supertype reference variable to a subtype reference variable.
